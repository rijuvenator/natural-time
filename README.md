# Natural Time

## Introduction
_Ben-Hur_ (1959) is 212 minutes long. Quick: How many hours and minutes is that?

It probably wasn't all that quick to figure out. First, you divide 212 by 60. If you use a calculator, you get 3.533... and then you take the 0.533, maybe you round it for convenience, and you multiply by 60 to get 31.98, which is pretty close to 32, so you conclude that it's 3 hours and 32 minutes. Or you didn't use a calculator, so you're doing long division by hand, so you think about how 60 &times; 3 is 180 and 60 &times; 4 is 240, so it's going to be 3 something, then you do the subtraction and end up with 32. Great. But it's kind of annoying, right?

Here are some more examples of time-related arithmetic that _should_ be a little simpler than they are:

  * How many seconds are in a day?
  * How many minutes pass between 7:53 am and 1:36 pm?
  * If it's currently 10:43 am, what time will it be in 3.75 hours?
  * How much time is 2/5 (40%) of four hours?

Now think about similar arithmetic with the metric system.

  * How many mL are in 2.12 L? Just move the decimal point: 2120 mL.
  * What is the difference between 75.3 cm and 13.6 cm? Just subtract: 61.7 cm.
  * If you have 10.43 kg, and you add 3.75 kg, how much mass do you have? Just add: 14.18 kg.
  * How much space is 2/5 (40%) of 4 GB? Just multiply: 1.6 GB.

Wouldn't it be nice if _time_ were as easy to work with as most of our other measurements?
